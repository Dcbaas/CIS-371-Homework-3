          This site calls the OpenDota Api. Dota 2 is a MOBA game similar to
          Leauge of Legends if you are familier with that game. The data set
          found is a random set of pubic matches that have been played on Dota 2
          and had stats recorded for them. The data we see is the match Id of
          the match played, The winner of the match (Radient or Dire) And the
          average match making rank of all the players in the match. Sometimes
          MMR is null because the players in game have not calibrated thier MMR
          yet. A difference from part 1 of this assignment and this section is
          that row color is determined by the winner of the match. Green is for
          Radiant and Red is for Dire.
